  <h1 class="blue">[SOFT] The Quick and Dirty Guide to youtube-dl</h1>

<p class="byline">
tl;dr: We wanted to save ourselves some bandwidth and download YouTube videos we love instead of streaming them constantly. Perfect job for a Raspberry Pi we had lying around.
</p>

<p>
First off, let's install <code>youtube-dl</code> on a fresh Raspbian install. You might be tempted to use a simple <code>apt-get</code>: don't. It will make it harder to get the latest updates for the software down the road. Instead:
<ul>
<li>Download the software - <code>sudo curl -L https://yt-dl.org/downloads/latest/youtube-dl -o /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl</code></li>
<li>Get the permission to execute the software on your Pi - <code>sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl</code></li>
<li>After it's done, test the software responds correctly - <code>youtube-dl -U</code></li>
</ul>
If everything went well, <code>youtube-dl</code> will tell you you have an up-to-date version installed! Now we're ready to download some videos.
</p>

<p>
Go to the URL of the video you want to download and, in terminal, type <code>youtube-dl [URL]</code>. Videos will download to the directory where you are located in two files - one for best video, one for best audio - before mixing both into an <code>.mkv</code> file.<br>
There are more things you can do to make your life with <code>youtube-dl</code> even better:
<ul>
<li>Download a video and format the title to remove amy special characters - <code>youtube-dl --restrict-filename [URL]</code></li>
<li>Download all the videos from a playlist and rename each file with the title of the video - <code>youtube-dl --download-archive archive.txt [PlaylistURL]</code></li>
<li>Download only the audio track of that mix you dig, or that vlog you can't get enough of - <code>youtube-dl -f 'bestaudio' --restrict-filename [URL]</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
That's it! Enjoy the YouTube goodness, all local.
