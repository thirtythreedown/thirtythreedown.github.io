<h1>[HARD] Keyes 3W LED module</h1>

<p>
tl;dr: Em picked up a box of Inland Arduino sensors a while back: they came pretty much without any documentation. She's been doing some research for a while and wanted to share, one module at a time. We hope it helps!
</p>
<b>Pin connections</b>
<ul>
  <li>+ goes to your Arduino +5V pin;
  <li>G goes to your Arduino Ground pin;
  <li>S goes to an Arduino digital pin;
</ul>

<p>
And that's it! Once wired in, you can use this LED module just like a basic LED - just much <i>much</i> brighter. Don't stare at it directly!<br>
