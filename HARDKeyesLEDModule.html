<h1>[HARD] Keyes 3W LED module</h1>

<p>
tl;dr: Em is documenting her way through a box of Arduino modules. We hope it helps.
</p>

<p>
<b>Pin connections</b>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
  <li>+ goes to your Arduino +5V pin.
  <li>G goes to your Arduino Ground pin.
  <li>S goes to an Arduino digital pin.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Once wired and powered, use like a basic LED. Example sketches Blink and Fade work well with it - the module will actually shine nice and bright directly from the Arduino’s 5V pin.
</p>

<p>
This LED module packs a serious punch: the box describes it as a 3W LED, which is a simple way to say “don’t stare at it directly in the face or you’ll get light spots in your eyes for a few minutes”. Bee tried, didn’t like it, then found the manufacturer documentation rating this LED module’s light output at anywhere between 180 and 200 lumens.
</p>

<p>
Em has been able to power it from a benchtop power supply....Once, then never again. The power supply still works, the power leads still work, the LED module still works - but it just won’t draw power from the supply for some reason!
