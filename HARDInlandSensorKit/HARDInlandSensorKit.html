  <h4>Vibration Sensor</h4>
  <img src="KY0002-VibrationSensor.JPG" alt="VibrationSensor">
	<p>
	The vibration sensor consists of a spring connected to one
	contact and a pin inside the spring connected to the other
	contact. Vibration of the spring will cause the spring to come
	into contact with the pin, closing the switch circuit briefly.
	</p>

	<p>
	The surface mount resistor (103 = 10K ohms) pulls the signal
	pin up to +5V. When the contacts close, the signal pin is
	pulled to ground.

  <h4>#17-IR transmitter</h4>
    <img src="KY005-IRLED.JPG" alt="IRLED">
  	<p>
  	The transmitter is an infrared LED. There is no current
  	limiting resister on the module, so you should place one
  	between the (S) signal pin and your source.
  	</p>

  	<p>
  	Only 2 pins are used:
  	<ul>
  	<li>(-) Ground
  	<li>(S) Signal (the center pin is not connected.)
  	</ul>
  	</p>

  	<p>
  	When the Signal pin supplies positive
  	voltage, the Infrared LED will illuminate. Tip: you can verify
  	operation by viewing the LED through a digital camera or
  	smartphone camera. CCD cameras are sensitive into the
  	infrared, and your display should show when the LED is on.

  <h4>#8/9-Passive & Active buzzers</h4>
  <img src="KY006-PassiveBuzzer.JPG" alt="PassiveBuzzer">
  <img src="KY012-ActiveBuzzer.JPG" alt="ActiveBuzzer">
  <p>
  Use as a speaker, buzzer or other audible indicator.
  The Active buzzer has a protective tag over the opening, note
  the + identifies the positive pin of the device, as the rear is
  covered with epoxy. The active buzzer will generate a tone as
  soon as power is supplied to the device.
  </p>

  <p>
  Passive buzzers must have a modulated signal supplied
  to the device (like a speaker) and would only generate a
  "click" if DC voltage is applied.
  Play a tone or melody using the passive buzzer:

  <b>Pin connections</b>
	<ul>
    <li>+ = +5V
		<li>G = ground
		<li>S = signal
	</ul>

	<p>
	The 3W White LED module uses a surface-mount transistor
	to control the brightness of the LED while drawing minimal
	current from the Arduino signal pin output (S).
	</p>

	<p>
	The Arduino IDE includes several examples for use with LEDs, see:
	<ul>
		<li>File, Examples, 01.Basic, Blink
		<li>File, Examples, 01.Basic, Fade
	</ul>
	</p>



	<h4>#6-LED - RGB Module</h4>
	<p>
	Current-limiting resistors (151 = 1 5 *10 = 150 ohm) are
	already attached to the positive Red, Green, and Blue pins of
	the LED. Connect the negative (-) pin to your ground, and the
	R, G, and B pins to your Arduino output pins.
	</p>
	<p>
	If using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) capable outputs, you
	can effectively mix the RGB primary colors to produce
	thousands or different output colors in the single LED. See:
	File, Examples, 01.Basic, Fade sketch example in the IDE - http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/RGBLEDPWM
	</p>





	<h4>Light Cup (LED + Mercury Tilt Switch)</h4>
  <img src="KY017-LightCup.JPG" alt="LightCup">
	<p>
	Pin connections
	<ul>
    <li>(+) +5V,
		<li>(G) ground,
		<li>(S) signal from the mercury switch, and
		<li>(L) for LED +.
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
	You should use a current limiting resistor between the (L) pin and your positive voltage
	source or Arduino signal pin. The negative pin of the LED connects to the (G) ground.
	The surface mount resistor (103 = 10K ohms) pulls the signal pin up to +5V. When the mercury shorts the two contacts,
	the signal pin is pulled to ground
	</p>

<h4>5V relay module</h4>
<img src="KY019-5VRelay.JPG" alt="5VRelay">
<b>Input pins</b>
<ul>
  <li>(+) +5V
  <li>(-) Ground
  <li>(S) Signal - connect to your Arduino "signal" pin to trip the relay.
</ul>

<p>
To use an external 5V source to power the relay coil or servo
motors, connect the ground of the external source to the
Arduino ground.
</p>

<p>
Three output (screw) pins
<ul>
<li>Center is common,
<li>NC indicates Normally Closed (ON),
<li>NO indicates Normally Open (OFF).
</ul>

When relay engages, the NC contact will open, the NO
contact will close.
</p>

<ul>
<li>https://tkkrlab.nl/wiki/Arduino_KY-019_5V_relay_module
</ul>


<h4>Ball tilt sensor</h4>
<img src="KY021-BallTiltSensor.JPG" alt="BallTiltSensor">
<p>
This is a very simple switch with a ball inside of the chamber.
When the sensor is tipped past the horizontal, the ball will
touch the top and bottom contacts, closing the switch.
The surface mount resistor (103 = 10K ohms) pulls the signal
pin up to +5V. When the contacts close, the signal pin is
pulled to ground
</p>

<ul>
<li>https://tkkrlab.nl/wiki/Arduino_KY-020_Tilt_switch_module
</ul>


<h4>IR receiver (VS1838B or similar)</h4>
<img src="KY022-IRReceiver.JPG" alt="IRReceiver">
<p>
<b>Pin conections</b>
<ul>
  <li>Vcc pin to your 5V pin
  <li>Gnd to a Ground pin
  <li>The Signal pin connects to an Arduino input pin and will
  change when the sensor detects an Infrared signal.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
An IR remote control will send coded pulses based on which
button you press, or an IR LED will produce a continuous
illumination.
</p>

<p>
The surface-mount LED connects to the signal pin of the
receiver. It will illuminate when the sensor detects an active
infrared source.
</p>


	<h4>#18-IR Collision Detector</h4>
  <img src="KY032-IRCollisionDetector.JPG" alt="IRCollisionDetector">
	<p>
	Typical use is with robots as collision avoidance detection,
	but it can also be used to detect a high-contrast mark on a
	rotating wheel, belt or tank tread (optical encoder).
	Sensitivity and LED brightness can be adjusted using the
	two potentiometers on the module.
	</p>

	<p>
	The module consists of an infrared LED unit and an infrared
	detector that can trigger a signal based on the intensity of
	reflected IR light. Note the heat-shrink tubing over the LED -
	used to block side-shining IR light from the sensor. Pled =
	power LED; will illuminate when +5V and ground are
	connected. Sled = Signal LED; will illuminate if detector is
	enabled and reflected (or transmitted) IR light is detected.
	</p>

	<b>Pin connections</b>
	<ul>
    <li>(+) +5v
	  <li>(GND) Ground
	  <li>(out) Output signal from detector
	  <li>(EN) Enable External Vcc connection to detector; active if jumper "EN" is removed.
	</ul>

	<h4>#19-IR line follower</h4>
  <img src="KY033-IRLineFollower.JPG" alt="IRLineFollower">
	<p>
	Typical use is with robots for detecting and following a line.
	Other uses include using the module as an optical encoder
	to detect revolutions of a wheel or belt, etc. Sensitivity can
	be adjusted using the potentiometer on the module. The
	LED is connected to the (S) Signal pin, and illuminates when
	an IR source (or reflection) is detected.
	</p>

	<p>
	The module consists of an infrared LED unit and an infrared
	detector that can trigger a signal based on the intensity of
	reflected IR light. Line following robots typically use a
	minimum of 2 line following sensors to keep the robot
	"centered" with the line between the two sensors.
	</p>

	<p>
	<b>Pin connections</b>
	<ul>
    <li>(V+) + 5V
	  <li>(G) Ground
	  <li>(S) Signal: low level when detecting reflected IR
	  <li>light, high when out of range (i.e. edge detection) or low reflectivity (i.e. black tape.)
	</ul>
	<ul>
	</p>

	<h4>#20-Real time clock modules</h4>
  <img src="KYXXX-RTCClock.JPG" alt="RTCClock">
	<p>
	The Tiny RTC communicates with a microprocessor via the
	I2C serial interface. The real-time clock/calendar provides
	seconds, minutes, hours, day, date, month, and year
	information.
	</p>

	<p>
	<b>Pin connections</b>
	<ul>
		<li>BAT: Battery voltage monitor (not used)
		<li>GND: Ground
		<li>VCC: +5V
		<li>SDA: I2C data (connect to A4)
		<li>SCL: I2C clock (connect to A5)
		<li>DS: DS18B20 Temp. Sensor output (connect to D2)
		<li>SQ: Square wave output (not used)
	</ul>

	</p>

	<h4>#21-Laser module</h4>
  <img src="KY008-LaserEmitter.JPG" alt="LaserEmitter">
	<p>
	The Laser is a basic 650nm red LED laser that can be used as
	a light source for a photo resistor module to create a laser
	"trip wire", or it can be modulated through the (S) signal
	line to transmit a digital signal. You can also connect this
	using just the Ground and Signal pin (the center-pin resistor
	will further limit the current and provide a dimmer output.)
	</p>

	<p>
	<b>Pin connections</b>
	<ul>
		<li>(S) Signal
		<li>(center pin) +5V
		<li>(-) Ground
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
	With the ground and +5V pin connected, the laser will
	illuminate because the resistor between the center pin and
	(S) signal pin completes the circuit. If a signal is provided
	(+5V) on the signal pin, the laser remains on, but if the
	signal pin goes negative (ground), the laser will turn off.
	</p>

</ul>
	</p>

	<h4>#22-Linear hall sensor - (SS49E or equivalent Linear Hall Effect Sensor)</h4>
	<p> The Hall Effect sensor is very sensitive to magnetic fields, and
	instead of generating just an on/off condition like a reed
	switch, field strength may be monitored as an analog signal.
	To use D0 as a digital trigger input; adjust sensitivity via the
	screw on the potentiometer.
	</p>

	<p>
	For typical specifications see:

	</ul>

	<h4>#23-Touch Sensor</h4>
  <img src="KY003-TouchSensor.JPG" alt="TouchSensor">
	<p>
	The tough sensor module uses an MPSA13 (or equivalent)
	NPN Darlington Transistor. The base of the transistor is left
	unconnected and wraps around the insulated package to
	serve as an antenna. When the exposed lead is touched, the
	module will act like a momentary switch where the signal
	can be monitored on the D0 pin, adjust sensitivity via the
	screw on the potentiometer.
	</p>

	<p>
	<b>Pin connections</b>
	<ul>
		<li>(AO) Analog Output - You could monitor this to detect the gradual change from the transistor as you come near the transistor lead.
		<li>(G) Ground
		<li>(+) +5V
		<li>(DO) Digital Output - this will produce a digital signal similar to a button switch.
	</ul>
	</p>

</ul>

	#24-Rotary Encoder</h4>
  <img src="KY040-RotaryEncoder.JPG" alt="RotaryEncoder">
	<p>
	The encoder generates two sets of square wave (on/off) pulses from the Clock and Data pins.
	These can be used to track the rotation of the shaft in either a clockwise or
	counterclockwise rotation. The encoder also incorporates a momentary push-button switch that is actuated by pressing
	down on the shaft.
	</p>

	<p>
	<b>Pin connections</b>
	<ul>
		<li>(CLK) Clock
		<li>(DT) Data

<h4>Extra resources</h4>
Several sites have hook-up and information and code examples on a variety of sensors, similar to, and including the ones
found in this kit. Some sensors may be loose components or integrated into different board designs. If the documented
sensor uses the same electronic component, then any code sketch documented may work with the sensors found in
your kit. However, depending on the circuit design, the adjustments or sensitivity range may need to be modified slightly
to achieve the desired result. Sites documenting these and other sensors include:
