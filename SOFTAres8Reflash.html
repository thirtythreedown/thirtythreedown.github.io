  <h1>[SOFT] Reflashing the Nextbook Ares 8 tablet</h1>

<p>
tl;dr: One day our Nextbook Ares 8 tablets simply stopped working. This is how we fixed them.
</p>

<p>
The Nextbook Ares 8 tablet is a great device for its price range. We use ours for technical documentation and library access. They suddenly stopped working a while back, and based on XDA Forums cries for help, so did a lot of people's. This is how we fixed our tablets using resources posted out there and a Windows computer.</p>

<p>
<b>WARNING: Please note that all your data on the device will be wiped, and encryption will be disabled. We are NOT responsible for any damage to your tablet, your computer or any hardware involved in this tutorial.</b>
</p>

<p>
Huge thanks go to  XDA Forums users <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=2472806">@vampirefo</a>, <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=4821597">@socialdesignconcepts</a> and <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=289644">@greatbal</a> for all their work on these machines.
</p>

<h2>Downloading and installing all the things</h2>
<p>
Let's start by installing all the software you will need on your computer.
</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>Download and install the <a href="https://androidmtk.com/download-manufacturing-flash-tool">Intel Manufacturing Flash tool</a> and the iSOC and ADB driver.</li>
<li>Follow the instructions to install <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/software/guide-how-to-set-fastboot-adb-to-wide-t3591240">the ADB and Fastboot</a> tools systemwide.</li>
<li>Charge your tablet.</li>
<li>Download the <code>Ares8_resize_partions.zip</code> files from <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/development/partition-ares-8-tablet-linux-windows-t3327595">Vampirefo's Partition Ares 8 Tablet Linux and Windows script thread</a>.</li>
<li>Extract the ZIP archive to your computer.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Everything should be ready. We can now start reflashing your tablet.
</p>

<h2>Reflashing the .EFI file</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>Open the unzipped <code>ares8_resize_partions.zip</code> folder.</li>
<li>In the unzipped folder, extract the <code>esp.zip</code> archive.</li>
<li>Open the Windows Command Prompt terminal and go to the unzipped <code>esp</code> folder using the <code>cd</code> command, all the way to the <code>\EFI\Intel\</code> folder, where you will find the <code>efilinux.efi</code>.</li>
<li>Keep both VOLUME DOWN and VOLUME UP buttons pressed as you turn on the tablet. It should boot to a black screen reading <code>Entering DNX mode. Waiting for fastboot command...</code>.</li>
<li>Connect your tablet to your computer with a USB cable.</li>
<li>From your terminal, type <code>fastboot flash osloader efilinux.efi</code>. Wait for the command to finish with an <code>OKAY</code> message on your screen.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reflashing the bootloader</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>Use the <code>cd</code> command in your terminal to navigate back to the unzipped <code>Ares8_resize_partitions</code> folder.</li>
<li>Type <code>fastboot boot droidboot.img</code>. Wait for the command to finish with an <code>OKAY</code> message on your screen.</li>
<li>Turn off your tablet.</li>
<li>Keep VOLUME DOWN pressed as you turn on the tablet. It should boot into the Android bootloader (with the Android robot lying on its back).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Pat yourself on the back - you finished the first big step! Next up is rebuilding the partitions on your tablet and reflashing the operating system on it.</li>
</p>

<h2>Repartitioning and reflashing</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>Browse to the unzipped Ares8_resize_partition folder.</li>
<li>In the folder, edit the <code>fastboot_cmd.bat</code> file to read all the fastboot commands.</li>
<li>From the terminal, type in all the commands, one at a time. Some of them will take time: be patient and let them finish with an <code>OKAY</code> message.</li>
<li>When you get to commands involving <code>partition.tbl</code>, replace the file name with <code>stockpartition.tbl</code> instead.</li>
<li>Type in the rest of the commands normally in the terminal, always waiting for <code>OKAY</code>.</li>
<li>Finally, use the VOLUME DOWN button to select RECOVERY MODE and use the POWER button to restart.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The tablet will now reboot into TWRP recovery. If it responds correctly to touch input, turn it off.
</p>

<h2>Reflashing the /system folder</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>Download the <code>Ares8_stock_rom.zip</code> file from the <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/development/partition-ares-8-tablet-linux-windows-t3327595">Partition Ares 8 Tablet Linux and Windows script</a>.</li>
<li>Copy the <code>Ares8_stock_rom.zip</code> file on a MicroSD card and put it into your tablet.</li>
<li>Keep the VOLUME UP button pressed as you turn on your tablet to boot into TWRP recovery.</li>
<li>Go to INSTALL.</li>
<li>Select STORAGE, then MicroSD card.</li>
<li>Select the <code>Ares8_stock_rom.zip</code> file. Un-check the MD5 verifications option.</li>
<li>Swipe right to confirm flashing. You might get a warning about a missing partition path for /sdcard, but it shouldnâ€™t be a problem. The flashing will take a while - about 20 minutes on the tablets we restored. Do not interrupt it! If the screen goes to sleep, you can wake it up with a quick press on the POWER button.</li>
<li>When TWRP Recovery prompts you to wipe cache and DALVIK, swipe right to accept.</li>
<li>Finally, reboot the tablet.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The first boot will take at least 5 minutes, then walk you through the original setup for the tablet. Set up time zone, date and time and enjoy your reflashed tablet!
