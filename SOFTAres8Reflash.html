  <h1>[SOFT] Reflashing the Nextbook Ares 8 tablet</h1>

<p>
tl;dr: One day our Nextbook Ares 8 tablets simply stopped working. This is how we fixed them.
</p>

<p>
The Nextbook Ares 8 tablet is a great device for its price range. In 2018, it makes for a near-unbeatable ebooks reader: we use them for technical documentation and library access. Ours stopped working and based on XDA Forums cries for help, so did a lot of people. This is how we fixed them using resources out there and a Windows computer.</p>

<p>
<b>WARNING: Please note that all your data on the device will be wiped, and encryption will be disabled. We are NOT responsible for any damage to your tablet, your computer or any hardware involved in this tutorial.</b>
</p>

<p>
Huge thanks go to  XDA Forums users @vampirefo, @socialdesignconcepts and @greatbal for all their work on these machines.

<li>Swipe to confirm Flash. You night get a warning about a missing partition path for /sdcard, but it shouldn’t be a problem. The flashing will take a while - about 20 minutes on the tablets we restored. Do not interrupt it! If the screen goes to sleep, you can wake it up with a quick press on the POWER button.</li>
<li>When the TWRP Recovery prompts you to wipe cache and DALVIK, swipe right to accept.</li>
<li>Finally, reboot the tablet.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The first boot will take at least 5 minutes, then walk you through the original setup for the tablet. Set up time zone, date and time and enjoy your reflashed tablet!
