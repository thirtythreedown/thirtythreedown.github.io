  <h1 class="blue">[SOFT] Easily sharing Raspberry Pi folders over your network</h1>

<p class="byline">
tl;dr: Forget the outdated, erroneous (or both!) tutorials for Samba out there. Use SSH's SFTP and an FTP client instead.
</p>

<p>
Sharing files and folders over a local network is one of the first things we wanted to do with a Raspberry Pi computer. There are many, many routers out there and many, many different default options. Because of that, we think file- and folder-sharing software Samba is not always reliable option (but if it works on your network, more power to you).
</p>

<p>
<b>
This file- and folder- sharing technique uses SSH credentials for the Raspberry Pi. Be careful who you share these credentials with!
</b>
</p>

<p>
Instead of using Samba, we decided to use SFTP, an SSH extension for secure file transfer.
</p>
<br>
<b>Activating SSH</b>
<p>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>In your Pi terminal, start the raspi-config utility - <code>sudo raspi-config</code>.</li>
<li>In the raspi-config menu, choose option 5 - <code>Interfacing Options</code>.</li>
<li>In the Interfacing Options menu, choose option P2 - <code>Enable/Disable command line access to your Pi using SSH</code>.</li>
<li>On the following screen, choose Yes to confirm activating SSH. The next screen will confirm SSH is activated.</li>
<li>Reboot your Pi.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<b>Finding your Pi's IP address</b>
<p>Now that your Pi has restarted, both SSH and SFTP should be running in the background. Let's find out where it is on our network with the <code>ifconfig</code> command in the terminal. 
</p>

<p>
You should be able to find your IP address in the <code>inet</code> field under the corresponding network adapter: <code>eth0</code> if your Raspberry Pi is wired to your router, <code>wlan0</code> if you are using WiFi. It will look like a string of numbers like <code>111.222.3.44</code>. Write that IP address down, we'll be using it in to connect to our Pi in a moment!
</p>

<b>Connecting to your Pi's SFTP server</b>
<p>
Your Pi is now running a SFTP <i>server</i>: we are going to use a SFTP <i>client</i> to access it.
</p>

<p>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>Download, install and run a copy of the <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client">Filezilla FTP client</a>.</li>
<li>In the Host field, type in the address of your Pi.</li>
<li>In the Username field, type in your Raspberry Pi username.</li>
<li>In the Password field, type in your Raspberry Pi password.</li>
<li>In the Port field, type in 22, the default port for SFTP.</li>
<li>Finally, click Quickconnect.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
You should now be logged in to your Raspberry Pi, and be able to access all the file and folders you need from there: you can drag and drops to and from your Raspberry Pi directly using the FileZilla client. Congratulations!
</p>

<b>How do we use it?</b>
<p>
We use Raspberry Pis to host a lot of music and video files at the studio. An easy way to use this method to stream media files is to:
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>Connect to your SFTP server.</li>
<li>Browse to the file or folder you want to open on the server.</li>
<li>Right-click on the file or folder and select <code>Copy URL(s) to clipboard</code>.</li>
<li>Open VLC Media Player.</li>
<li>In the File menu, choose <code>Open location from clipboard</code> (the URL will likely already be filled in, but paste it yourself if needed).</li>
<li>Click <code>Play</code> or <code>Enqueue</code>, your choice.</li>
</ul>
That's it! After a (usually short) loading time, VLC will start playing the file or folder. Enjoy!
</p>
