<p>
tl;dr: We needed graphics for our (really silly) Patreon rewards tiers. June made us tiles inspired by one of her mobile gaming faves.
</p>

The tiles go from 1 to 2048. Their design is inspired by axilleasiv's <a href="https://github.com/axilleasiv/vue2048">vue2048</a>.

<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>Remix the files on <a href="https://github.com/thirtythreedown/2048-tiles">the 2048-tiles repository</a><br></li>
<li>Throw some money at us, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/thirtythreedown">become a patron</a>.</li>
<li>Slap it on a tee shirt, put it on a sticker at  <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/thirtythreedown/works/28857137-2048-tile">Redbubble</a>.</li>
</ul>
