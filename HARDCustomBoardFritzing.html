<h1 class="red">[SOFT] Custom circuit board shape for Fritzing in Inkscape</h1>

<p class="byline">
tl;dr: A short explanation of how to make your own board shapes in Fritzing.
</p>

Convention badges, game controllers, mechanical keyboards: there are tons of projects out there requiring a circuit board that doesn't look like a plain rectangle.

<h2>Designing your board shape</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>Draw your shape.</li>
<li>Give your shape a color. Preferably make it easy on the eyes: when you work on a board, you're going to spend a long time looking at it! You can adjust the <code>Fill</code> color and the <code>Opacity</code> settings until you like it.</li>
<li>Create a sub-layer named "<code>board</code>".</li>
<li>Right-click on the "<code>board</code>" layer to duplicate it and rename it "<code>silkscreen</code>". This layer should be on top.</li>
<li>Click on the shape of your board in the "<code>silkscreen</code>" layer. In the Object menu, select <code>Fill</code> and <code>Stroke</code>. Make sure there is no fill color on this layer, only a stroke.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Setting up your board for Fritzing</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>Open the XML editor - <code>Edit > XML Editor</code> or <code>Control + Shift + X</code>.</li>
<li>Look for the lines with "<code>inkscape:label=</code>" followed by the name of your layers. These lines define the name of each layer in your design.</li>
<li>On the line for each layer, click on the name in "<code>id</code>" value to your right and change it to the name of your layer. For example, the board layer's original id might be "<code>layer2</code>": change this to "<code>board</code>", then click the "<code>Set</code>" button.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Saving for Fritzing</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>Go to <code>File > Document Properties</code>.</li>
<li>In the <code>Custom size</code> section , click on the <code> Resize page to drawing or selection</code> button.</li>
<li>Finally, click on <code>File > Save As...</code> to save your design as Plain SVG.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Importing your board in Fritzing</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>Start Fritzing and create a new project.</li>
<li>Click on the <code>PCB</code> tab at the top of the screen.</li>
<li>Drag a PCB on the main section of the screen or. If you already have a PCB there, just left-click on it.</li>
<li>In the Inspector to the bottom right of your screen, click on <code>Load image file</code>.</li>
<li>Browse to the SVG file you saved earlier, then click <code>Open</code>.</li>
</ul>
Inkscape will confirm loading your board, and warn you about some of its features. If everything looks right, congratulations! You designed your owb PCB shape. If not, go back a few steps to see where you made a mistake, or start over entirely.
