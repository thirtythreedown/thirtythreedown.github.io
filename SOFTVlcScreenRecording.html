  <h1>[SOFT] VLC screen recording - single screen edition</h1>

<p>
tl;dr: We have an operational budget of about 75 dollars and will not invest into capture hardware anytime soon. Free, open source VLC software to the rescue.
</p>

<p>
We are broke as eff and June and Bee have been looking to document our development work without breaking the bank. They eventually stopped refreshing ShopGoodwill every five minutes and went to VLC Media Player instead.
</p>

<b>Setting up VLC recording</b>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>Open VLC</li>
<li>Click <b>Media > Convert/Save</b> to open the recording menu.</li>
<li>In the <b>Capture</b> device tab, select Desktop from the Capture mode drop-dowm menu.</li>
<li>In the <b>Desired frame rate</b> menu, type in your frame rate (June usually goes for 30fps)</li>
<li>Check <b>Show more options</b> to open even more options (yup). We usually leave all the options alone, unless you're recording on a dual screen setup.</li>
<li>Finally, click <b>Convert/Save</b> - you are done with the first step!</li>
</ul>

<b>Setting up VLC output</b>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>In the <b>Convert</b> screen, choose a profile from the drop down menu - we usually go for <b>Video - H.264 + MP3 (MP4)</b>.</li>
<li>Click on the <b>Settings</b> icon next to the drop-down menu to open the Profile edition screen.</li>
<li>In the <b>Capture device</b> tab, select Desktop from the Capture mode drop-down menu.</li>
<li>In the <b>Encapsulation</b> tab, we usually leave eveything alone.</li>
<li>In the <b>Video Codec</b> tab, same thing, we usually don't touch anything either.</li>
<li>In the <b>Audio Codec</b> tab, we usually uncheck Audio because we love the sound of silence. Also we're done here - click <b>Save</b>.</li>
<li>Back on the <b>Convert</b> screen, click Browse to choose a destination - let's say example.mp4 on your desktop.</li>
<li>Finally, click <b>Start</b> to start recording!.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Nothing seems to happen but make no mistake, VLC is already recording and you now have a example.mp4 file on your desktop where everything happening on your screen is being captured.
</p>

<p>
You can do a lot more with VLC Media Player and we have only grazed the surface. There is a ton to explore here, check below for more.
