  <h1>[SOFT] VLC screen recording - single screen edition</h1>

<p>
tl;dr: A set of instructions to capture a dual screen computer setup with VLC.
</p>

<b>Setting up VLC recording</b>
<p>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>Open VLC</li>
<li>Click Media > Convert/Save to open the recording menu.</li>
<li>In the Capture device tab, select Desktop from the Capture mode drop-dowm menu.</li>
<li>In the Desired frame rate menu, type in your frame rate (June usually goes for 30fps).</li>
<li>Check Show more options to open even more options (yup). We usually leave all the options alone, unless you're recording on a dual screen setup.</li>
<li>Finally, click Convert/Save.</li>
</ul>
You are done with the first step!
</p>

<b>Setting up VLC output and recording</b>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
  <p>
<li>In the Convert screen, choose a profile from the drop down menu - we usually go for Video - H.264 + MP3 (MP4).</li>
<li>Click on the Settings icon next to the drop-down menu to open the Profile edition screen.</li>
<li>In the Capture device tab, select Desktop from the Capture mode drop-down menu.</li>
<li>In the Encapsulation tab, we usually leave eveything alone.</li>
<li>In the Video Codec tab, same thing, we usually don't touch anything either.</li>
<li>In the Audio Codec tab, we usually uncheck Audio because we love the sound of silence. Also we're done here - click Save.</li>
<li>Back on the Convert screen, click Browse to choose a destination - let's say example.mp4 on your desktop.</li>
<li>Finally, click Start to start recording!.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Nothing seems to happen but VLC should already recording and you should have a example.mp4 file on your desktop. Everything happening on your screen is being captured by VLC.
