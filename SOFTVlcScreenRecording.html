  <h1>[SOFT] VLC screen recording - single screen edition</h1>

<p>
tl;dr: We have an operational budget of about 75 dollars and will not invest into capture hardware anytime soon. Free, open source VLC software to the rescue.
</p>

<p>
We are broke as eff and June and Bee have been looking to document our development work without breaking the bank. They eventually stopped refreshing ShopGoodwill every five minutes and went to VLC Media Player instead.
</p>

<b>Setting up VLC recording</b>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>Open VLC</li>
<li>Click Media > Convert/Save to open the recording menu.</li>
<li>In the Capture device tab, select Desktop from the Capture mode drop-dowm menu.</li>
<li>In the Desired frame rate menu, type in your frame rate (June usually goes for 30fps).</li>
<li>Check Show more options to open even more options (yup). We usually leave all the options alone, unless you're recording on a dual screen setup.</li>
<li>Finally, click Convert/Save - you are done with the first step!</li>
</ul>

<b>Setting up VLC output</b>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>In the Convert screen, choose a profile from the drop down menu - we usually go for Video - H.264 + MP3 (MP4).</li>
<li>Click on the Settings icon next to the drop-down menu to open the Profile edition screen.</li>
<li>In the Capture device tab, select Desktop from the Capture mode drop-down menu.</li>
<li>In the Encapsulation tab, we usually leave eveything alone.</li>
<li>In the Video Codec tab, same thing, we usually don't touch anything either.</li>
<li>In the Audio Codec tab, we usually uncheck Audio because we love the sound of silence. Also we're done here - click Save.</li>
<li>Back on the Convert screen, click Browse to choose a destination - let's say example.mp4 on your desktop.</li>
<li>Finally, click Start to start recording!.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Nothing seems to happen but VLC should already recording and you should have a example.mp4 file on your desktop. Everything happening on your screen is being captured by VLC.
</p>

<p>
You can do a lot more with VLC Media Player and we have only grazed the surface. There is a ton to explore here, check below for more.
